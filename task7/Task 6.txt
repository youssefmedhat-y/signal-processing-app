Task 6
Add to your framework a menu named Time Domain that includes the following features:
1) Smoothing: Compute moving average y(n) for signal x(n) let the user enter the number of points included in averaging. (convolution)
2) Sharpening: Compute and display y (n) which represents
First Derivative of input signal  
Y(n) = x(n)-x(n-1)
Second derivative of input signal 
Y(n)= x(n+1)-2x(n)+x(n-1)    
3) Delaying or advancing a signal by k steps. 
4) Folding a signal. 
5) Delaying or advancing a folded signal. 
6) Remove the DC component in time domain.  Using mean
7) The ability to convolve two signals.  
8) The ability to compute normalized cross-correlation of two signals or normalized autocorrelation of a signal.
9) The ability to compute the normalized cross-correlation of periodic signals (not necessarily of same length).
10) Time Analysis: perform time delay analysis, given two periodic signals and the sampling period, find approximately the delay between them.
