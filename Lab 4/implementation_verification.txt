The implementation includes:

1. DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform):
   - Manually computes DFT without using numpy.fft
   - For each frequency component k:
     * Computes real and imaginary parts using:
       Real[k] = Σ x[n] * cos(-2πkn/N)
       Imag[k] = Σ x[n] * sin(-2πkn/N)
     * Calculates amplitude: sqrt(Real² + Imag²)
     * Calculates phase: arctan2(Imag, Real)
   - Returns frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts

2. IDFT (Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform):
   - Manually computes IDFT without using numpy.ifft
   - Reconstructs time domain signal from frequency components
   - For each time sample n:
     * Converts amplitude/phase to real/imaginary
     * Sums all frequency contributions
     * Divides by N to get the time domain value
   - Returns Signal object in time domain

3. Normalize Amplitudes:
   - Divides all amplitudes by the maximum amplitude
   - Results in normalized range [0, 1]

4. Remove DC Component:
   - Sets F[0] (zero frequency component) to zero
   - Removes the constant offset from the signal

5. Modify Components:
   - Allows changing amplitude and phase of any frequency index
   - Useful for filtering and signal manipulation

6. Dominant Frequencies:
   - Identifies frequency components with normalized amplitude > 0.5
   - Helps find the main frequency content of the signal

All features are integrated into the GUI with:
- Easy-to-use buttons in the "Frequency Domain" section
- Visual plots showing amplitude vs frequency and phase vs frequency
- Console output with detailed numerical results
