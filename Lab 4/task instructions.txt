Task 4
Add to your framework a menu named Frequency Domain that includes the following features:

1-The ability to apply discrete Fourier transform to any input signal implementing the discrete fourier transform without using the numpy fft then displays frequency versus amplitude
(normalize amplitude to be between 0 and 1 using the implemented function of signal normalization that it was implemented before) and frequency versus phase relations after 
asking the user to enter the sampling frequency in HZ.  

2-Display the dominant frequencies (frequencies with amplitudes > 0.5).
3-Allow modify the amplitude and phase of the signal components by selecting some index to change in 
4-Remove DC component (remove F(0)).
5-Allow signal reconstruction using IDFT. 


(Hint: due to the high similarity between DFT and IDFT try to have one smart code for both ;)
